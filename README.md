# RubberBand UGen for SuperCollider

RubberBand is a high-quality C++ library for pitch-shifting and time-stretching audio. I want to use it from a plugin in SuperCollider. This code doesn't work yet! But I'm learning!

### Reference

RubberBand implementation was mostly just copied from Ben Saylorâ€™s TuneTutor:
